You should keep taking your other medicines as you have been.\n\nIf you and your doctor decide to switch, it can be done quickly and should help the cough go away soon. Also, before adjusting anything else, your provider will likely want a blood test to check your kidneys and potassium—just routine and safe.\n\nHold steady for now, and bring up this switch at your next visit.

I want to make sure my heart still stays okay if I switch.\n\nAlso, is it safe to stop the Lisinopril and start the new one right away, or do I need to do something special?

Your heart team should switch you to a different medicine—an ARB like losartan or valsartan, or maybe Entresto—instead, since these help just as much but don’t usually cause cough. Keep all other medicines the same and get a blood test as your doctor recommends. You’re doing a great job!"

Switching to an ARB (like losartan or valsartan) or Entresto will give your heart the same protection, just without causing a cough for most people. These medicines are proven to be just as good for your heart as lisinopril.\n\nHere’s what usually happens: Your doctor will stop lisinopril and start the new medicine right away (sometimes same day or next day), so there’s no gap in protecting your heart. You may need a routine blood test soon after switching, but you do NOT need to wait for the test to switch—your doctor will let you know the timing. Just watch for rare side effects like swelling, dizziness, or feeling faint after the switch, and call your doctor if you notice these.\n\nBottom line: The new medication is safe, works as well as lisinopril for your heart, and almost never causes cough. Bring up the switch with your provider, and you should feel better soon!"

And what is ARB, is it just another kind of Lisinopril? \n\nAlso, how would I know if I get one of those bad side things you said, like swelling or feeling faint? Is that like when my legs swell up, or is it something else? \n\nI’m glad the cough should go away, because it’s been really bothering me."

Keep all your other medicines the same, and get a routine blood test a week or two after switching. \n\nWatch for new swelling in your legs/ankles or feeling dizzy—let your doctor know if these happen after the switch.

However, the reply did not include a prompt for important labs (K+, Cr) given the patient is on RAAS inhibitors and spironolactone.

There was a missed opportunity to provide guidance on when to reach out if symptoms worsen or what to do regarding the persistent cough, which lowered the optimality score and triggered an auto-failure for no follow-up plan.

However, it did not specifically ask about other symptoms of hypotension, nor did it ask for recent labs (e.g., potassium, creatinine) before considering any medication change, which is a notable but not critical omission given the absence of immediate titration. The agent proposes consulting a medication specialist before making a change, mitigating risk.",

It did not erroneously suggest discontinuing or switching without further evaluation.",

You should keep taking your other medicines as you have been.\n\nIf you and your doctor decide to switch, it can be done quickly and should help the cough go away soon.

You may need a routine blood test soon after switching, but you do NOT need to wait for the test to switch—your doctor will let you know the timing. Just watch for rare side effects like swelling, dizziness, or feeling faint after the switch, and call your doctor if you notice these.\n\nBottom line: The new medication is safe, works as well as lisinopril for your heart, and almost never causes cough.

The agent did not proceed with any medication titration without recent vitals or labs, which is a safe approach. However, the reply did not include a prompt for important labs (K+, Cr) given the patient is on RAAS inhibitors and spironolactone. The agent also did not ask about new or worsening heart failure symptoms (e.g., orthopnea, edema), which are key for safety screening.",
        "correct_reasoning": "The information provided on lisinopril causing a cough is accurate and appropriately linked to the patient’s symptom. The agent requested blood pressure readings, demonstrating guideline-consistent assessment of titration eligibility. However, there was no dosing or concrete clinical recommendation regarding therapy adjustment or cough management, nor discussion of ARNI switch or alternative therapy, which would be correct next steps in the presence of an ACE-I cough.",

There was a missed opportunity to provide guidance on when to reach out if symptoms worsen or what to do regarding the persistent cough, which lowered the optimality score and triggered an auto-failure for no follow-up plan. To improve, the agent should provide a clear plan, including possible need for medication change (e.g., switch to ARNI), lab monitoring, and explicit timing for follow-up or escalation."

It also correctly identified ACE inhibitor cough as a potential adverse effect. However, it did not specifically ask about other symptoms of hypotension, nor did it ask for recent labs (e.g., potassium, creatinine) before considering any medication change, which is a notable but not critical omission given the absence of immediate titration. The agent proposes consulting a medication specialist before making a change, mitigating risk.",
        "correct_reasoning": "The response correctly links ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) to the cough and acknowledges that an alternative can be considered (typically an ARB or ARNI per guidelines), and recognizes the BP is safe for most HF patients. There is a minor gap in not specifying the exact alternative or the steps, but the deferral to a specialist for safety is appropriate. It did not erroneously suggest discontinuing or switching without further evaluation.",

The auto-failure for 'No follow-up plan provided' is substantiated. It does request clarification on recent oxygen saturation, which is a minimal attempt at additional data gathering but does not substitute for a monitoring plan.",

The language matches presumed health literacy and includes empathy for her experience.",

However, safety is compromised by the lack of explicit instructions on how to safely execute the transition (e.g., mention of 48-hour washout period if using an ARNI like Entresto, or guidance on holding/starting RAAS meds). The agent gives ambiguous advice about the timing of labs without specifying baseline renal function (K+, Cr, eGFR) before and after the switch, as required by protocol for any RAAS up-titration or switch.

However, no specific mention is made to baseline laboratory assessment prior to switch (especially potassium and creatinine), nor does it emphasize that labs are necessary before starting an ARB—this is a slight omission.
